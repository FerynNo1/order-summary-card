## My process

This is my first Frontend Mentor project. I'm not quite sure what to expect and how easy or hard it will be. But let's give it a go.

11:47 AM EST:
Finally got Git to work. First time setting up Git Repo. Still not really comfortable using branches, commits, pushes aso. Started structuring the HTML now.

03:28 PM EST:
Had a  break. I'm pretty satisfied with how the order summary is looking now. It is not 100% correct, but we are getting really close. I feel a little like the way I wrote my css is completely wrong and all the hardcore devs reading it will be like: "oooh duude wtf." But hey, still learning - like I said I'm pretty satisfied.

03:43 PM EST:
Kinda finished. Sure there could be a little bit of tweaking but yeah. Spend a few hours on it, pretty proud that I managed to do this project without having to look up too much and didn't need that much time. So even if it's not 100% the way it should be, personally I see that as finished for my practice session today. :-)

### Built with
